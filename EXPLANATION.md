# ERP System - Design Rationale & Technical Decisions

This document explains the design choices, trade-offs, and architectural decisions made in building the ERP system, along with future improvement recommendations.

## üéØ Project Goals & Requirements

### Primary Objectives
1. **Simplicity**: Easy to understand, deploy, and maintain
2. **Scalability**: Ability to grow with business needs
3. **Security**: Robust authentication and authorization
4. **Developer Experience**: Fast development cycles and good tooling
5. **Production Ready**: Docker containerization and proper deployment setup

### Business Requirements
- Manage quotations and sales orders
- Role-based access control (ADMIN, SALES, CUSTOMER)
- Product and customer management
- Audit trail for status changes
- Responsive web interface

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture Decisions

### 1. Monolithic vs Microservices

**Decision**: Monolithic architecture with clear separation of concerns

**Rationale**:
- **Pros**:
  - Simpler deployment and debugging
  - Easier to maintain for small to medium teams
  - Lower operational complexity
  - Faster development cycles
  - Shared database transactions
- **Cons**:
  - Less flexibility for independent scaling
  - Technology lock-in across the entire application
  - Potential for codebase bloat over time

**Trade-offs**: Chose simplicity and development speed over microservices complexity for this initial implementation.

**Future Consideration**: Can be refactored into microservices when the team grows or specific services need independent scaling.

### 2. Technology Stack Selection

#### Frontend: React + TypeScript + Vite

**Why React?**
- **Mature ecosystem**: Extensive library support and community
- **Component reusability**: Atomic design pattern implementation
- **State management**: React Query for server state, Context for client state
- **TypeScript integration**: Excellent type safety and developer experience

**Why TypeScript?**
- **Type safety**: Catches errors at compile time
- **Better IDE support**: IntelliSense and refactoring tools
- **Self-documenting code**: Types serve as documentation
- **Team collaboration**: Easier for multiple developers to work together

**Why Vite?**
- **Fast development**: Hot module replacement and instant server start
- **Modern build tool**: ES modules and native browser features
- **Optimized production builds**: Tree shaking and code splitting
- **Plugin ecosystem**: Rich ecosystem for various tools

#### Backend: Node.js + Express + TypeScript

**Why Node.js?**
- **JavaScript ecosystem**: Shared language between frontend and backend
- **Performance**: Non-blocking I/O for handling concurrent requests
- **Rich ecosystem**: Extensive npm packages and tools
- **Developer productivity**: Fast development cycles

**Why Express?**
- **Minimal and flexible**: Lightweight framework with middleware support
- **Mature and stable**: Well-established in the Node.js ecosystem
- **Easy to understand**: Simple routing and middleware pattern
- **Extensible**: Easy to add features as needed

#### Database: PostgreSQL + Prisma

**Why PostgreSQL?**
- **ACID compliance**: Reliable transactions and data integrity
- **Rich feature set**: JSON support, full-text search, advanced indexing
- **Performance**: Excellent query performance and optimization
- **Open source**: No licensing costs

**Why Prisma?**
- **Type safety**: Generated TypeScript types from schema
- **Developer experience**: Excellent IDE support and auto-completion
- **Migration system**: Version-controlled database schema changes
- **Query optimization**: Efficient query building and optimization

### 3. Authentication & Authorization

#### JWT-based Authentication

**Decision**: JWT tokens for stateless authentication

**Rationale**:
- **Stateless**: No server-side session storage needed
- **Scalable**: Works well with load balancers and multiple instances
- **Mobile-friendly**: Easy to implement in mobile applications
- **Performance**: No database lookup required for each request

**Trade-offs**:
- **Token size**: JWTs can become large with user data
- **Revocation**: Cannot easily revoke individual tokens
- **Security**: Tokens stored in localStorage (XSS vulnerability)

**Mitigation Strategies**:
- Keep tokens small by storing minimal user data
- Implement token refresh mechanism
- Use httpOnly cookies for production (future improvement)

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)

**Implementation**: Simple role-based system with middleware

**Roles**:
- **ADMIN**: Full system access
- **SALES**: Quotation and sales order management
- **CUSTOMER**: Limited to own quotations

**Future Improvements**:
- Implement permission-based system for finer control
- Add role hierarchies
- Support for custom roles and permissions

### 4. Database Design

#### Schema Design Principles

**Normalization**: 3NF (Third Normal Form) with strategic denormalization

**Key Design Decisions**:
1. **User-Customer Relationship**: One-to-one relationship for customer accounts
2. **Quotation Items**: Separate table for line items with product references
3. **Status History**: Audit trail for quotation status changes
4. **Soft Deletes**: Considered but not implemented (future improvement)

**Trade-offs**:
- **Normalization vs Performance**: Balanced approach for query efficiency
- **Flexibility vs Complexity**: Structured schema with room for extension
- **Audit Trail**: Additional storage cost for historical data

#### Indexing Strategy

**Primary Indexes**:
- Primary keys on all tables
- Foreign key indexes for relationships
- Composite indexes for common query patterns

**Performance Considerations**:
- Index on `quotation.status` for filtering
- Index on `quotation.createdAt` for date range queries
- Full-text search indexes for product and customer names

### 5. API Design

#### RESTful API Principles

**Resource-Based URLs**:
- `/quotations` - Quotation resource
- `/sales-orders` - Sales order resource
- `/products` - Product resource
- `/customers` - Customer resource

**HTTP Methods**:
- GET: Retrieve resources
- POST: Create new resources
- PUT: Update existing resources
- DELETE: Remove resources (future implementation)

**Response Format**:
```json
{
  "data": [...],
  "meta": {
    "total": 100,
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "totalPages": 10
  }
}
```

#### Error Handling

**Standardized Error Responses**:
- Consistent error format across all endpoints
- Appropriate HTTP status codes
- Descriptive error messages
- Error logging for debugging

### 6. Frontend Architecture

#### Component Architecture

**Atomic Design Pattern**:
- **Atoms**: Basic UI components (Button, Input, Badge)
- **Molecules**: Simple combinations (LoginForm, ProductSelector)
- **Organisms**: Complex components (QuotationTable, Navbar)
- **Templates**: Page layouts
- **Pages**: Complete page implementations

**Benefits**:
- Reusable components
- Consistent design system
- Easy testing and maintenance
- Scalable component library

#### State Management

**React Query (TanStack Query)**:
- Server state management
- Automatic caching and background updates
- Optimistic updates
- Error handling and retry logic

**React Context**:
- Client state (authentication, theme)
- Simple state sharing across components
- No external dependencies

**Trade-offs**:
- React Query adds complexity but provides powerful features
- Context is simple but can lead to unnecessary re-renders

### 7. Containerization Strategy
